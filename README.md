Our team is very competetive when it comes to problem solving, even between our selves you always thrive to be better than one another.
So I came up with 
# Who Solved It

basically a web app that fetches data from Codeforces.com to quickly tell us who SOLVED, TRIED or have NOT SOLVED the given problem!
It is very handy when we need to create a Mashup contest without including problems we've seen before.
